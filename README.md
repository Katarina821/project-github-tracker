# GitHub Tracker
Assigment: To create a place to keep track of the GitHub repos that I am using at Technigo using JavaScript and API:s. 

## The problem
I had problems with fetching teh commitsamount for my repos since all of them didnt have a pullrequest done by me. I solved it by adding conditional statment to sort out the repos with a pullrequest and only fetcinh the commitamount for them.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
